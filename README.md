# MIT SureStart FutureMakers2022

This repo contains all the Google Colab assignments and work that I did as part of the MIT SureStart 6-week Machine Learning summer program. In the program, I learned many types of machine learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing models. Through the Google Colab Notebooks, I developed a thorough understanding of machine learning concepts.
